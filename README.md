# Ideology Of Design
As a beginner stepping into the world of both programming and ergonomic keyboards, My goal is to in equal parts challenge myself and learn as much as I can through research and experimentation while attempting to create a Keymap that is custom to myself and my goals using the Dactyl Manuform. The idea Behind the keymap is to create a completely custom to myself version inspired by several other keymaps and layer systems such as Manna_harbour's Miryoku layout or Sunaku's Golorious Engrammer both of these layouts and the methodology behind them have both pushed me forward and made me truly understand my love and desire for working in programming and creating with my own power.
